            <h1>Abstract</h1>
            <p>Total knee arthroplasty (TKA), also known as total knee replacement (TKR), involves replacing the knee joint with an artificial implant. This procedure can use one of two methods: cementless fixation, which relies on porous implants that promote bone growth for long-term durability and simpler revision surgeries, but requires greater surgical precision and a longer recovery period; or cemented fixation, which provides immediate stability, 
making it suitable for older patients or those with poor bone quality, though it may lead to complications such as cement wear and complex revision surgeries. The choice between these methods depends primarily on the patientâ€™s age, bone health, and activity level, with cementless fixation favored for younger, active individuals and cemented fixation for older, less active patients.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Total knee arthroplasty (TKA), also known as total knee replacement surgery (TKR), is a surgical procedure performed to alleviate chronic knee pain and restore joint mobility in patients with severe arthritis, osteonecrosis, or other degenerative joint diseases.

The TKA procedure consists of removing damaged cartilage and bone from the knee joint and replacing them with artificial components, usually made from metal alloys and durable plastics to simulate the functions of a healthy knee. Although TKA can provide long-term relief, the artificial implants wear over time and need revision, especially in younger and more active patients, who may need revision surgery in the future.

TKA is still one of the most effective treatments for severe knee degeneration, by relieving symptoms and restoring function when conservative treatments have failed. Globally, TKA has become one of the most common orthopaedic procedures, with over 100,000 operations performed annually in the UK alone. Cemented fixation is the predominant method, used in approximately 95% of primary TKR in the UK and 68% in Australia,
where cementless fixation accounts for only 11% of cases. However, advances in implant design and manufacturing technology have renewed interest in cementless fixation. This method offers potential advantages, such as shorter surgical times and the possibility of long-lasting biological fixation, making it a promising possibility for certain patient populations.</p>

        <h2>Main Body</h2>
        <h3>Cementless Fixation</h3>
        <p>Cementless fixation is done by press fitting the metal parts that attach to the femur and tibia. The components are made specifically with a porous surface to allow the bone to grow and attach itself to the components, and the bones are shaped in a way to ensure a tight fit around the implants. However, bone cement is used to fix the patella in place because the cementless method has been shown to be ineffective for this purpose.</p>
