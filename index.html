        <h1>A Scientific Comparison of Cemented and Cementless TKR</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Total knee arthroplasty (TKA), also known as total knee replacement surgery (TKR), is a surgical procedure performed to alleviate chronic knee pain and restore joint mobility in patients with severe arthritis, osteonecrosis,
            or other degenerative joint diseases. Surgery replacement will provide significant pain relief as well as return of mobility to the joint and prevent further damage and strain to spread to other joints such as the hips.
        </p>
        <p>
            The TKA procedure consists of removing damaged cartilage and bone from the knee joint and replacing them with artificial components, usually made from metal alloys and durable plastics to simulate the functions of a healthy knee.
            Although TKA can provide long-term relief, the artificial implants wear over time and need revision, especially in younger and more active patients, who may need revision surgery in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            TKA is still one of the most effective treatments for severe knee degeneration, by relieving symptoms and restoring function when conservative treatments have failed. Globally, TKA has become one of the most common orthopaedic procedures, with over 100,000 operations performed annually in the UK alone.
            Cemented fixation is the predominant method, used in approximately 95% of primary TKR in the UK and 68% in Australia, where cementless fixation accounts for only 11% of cases. However, advances in implant design and manufacturing technology have renewed interest in cementless fixation. This method offers potential advantages,
            such as shorter surgical times and the possibility of long-lasting biological fixation, making it a promising possibility for certain patient populations.
        </p>

        <h2>Main Body</h2>
        <p>
            During TKA, the metal parts of the prosthesis are fixed with two different methods:
        </p>

        <h3>Cementless Fixation</h3>
        <p>
            Cementless fixation is done by press fitting the metal parts that attach to the femur and tibia. 
            The components are made specifically with a porous surface to allow the bone to grow and attach itself to the bones and they are shaped in a way to ensure a tight fit around the implants.
            However, bone cement is used to fix the patella in place because the cementless method has been shown to be ineffective for this purpose.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Advantages:</b> This method does not have those drawbacks associated with the use of bone cement, such as the cement cracking and loosening, potentially leading to osteolysis. 
The procedure is viewed as being more suitable to younger and more active patients (under 60 years old). There is less concern about the implants loosening because the bone id healthier and the bone cells have a greater capacity to generate bone at the interface of the implant.
The surgery is much shorter because the surgeon does not need to wait for the cement to set, the procedure can also be used in tandem with cement in a hybrid approach to get the benefits of both. And the revision is simpler because the bone around the implant is going to be mostly intact and there is no cement that needs to be removed.
.</li>
            <li><b>Disadvantages:</b> The time needed for the implant to fully in place is much longer because it relies on bone growth for stability, which leads to instability and discomfort during the recovery period after surgery. 
                To get the procedure patients need to have good bone health, which is more typically found in younger patients. 
The procedure requires a high degree of surgical skill, for accurate bone removal to match with the interface of the implant and for the correct placement of the implant to ensure it proper fixation to the bone. Any gaps at the implant-bone interface could led to surgical failure. 
The method being quite recent the data on this type of implant is still lacking in the long-term studies on the outcomes and the long-term benefits and potential.
The period before the full growth of the bones in the implant occurs, the patients may experience discomfort and instability due to the lack of fixation.
Due to the cementless implants being usually more expensive because of the materials and design made to promote bone growth, the procedure can get quite expensive.
</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cemented Fixation</h3>
        <p>
            The surgeon must drill a hole in the tibia slightly larger than the implant, to leave space in between the implant and the bone to apply a product called bone cement, a mixture that is long lasting as well as fast hardening. 
            The implants are different to the cementless one because there is no need for the porous surface, as the bone cement fixes the implant properly without it. 
            And as mentioned above, the patella is fixed to the knee with bone cement in both cases.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Advantages:</b> This procedure is older, so more research is available on its drawbacks and durability: it last on average around 10-20 years without the need of a revision surgery.
The recovery time after the procedure is shorter as there is no need for the bone to attach itself to the implant, the stability of the implant is immediate.
The composition of the cement can contain antibiotics, and therefore can lower the risk of an infection.
The cemented procedure requires much less manipulation of the adjoining interfaces of the knee during surgery because a tight fit with the implant is not essential. This also means that there tends to be less blood lost during the procedure. Post surgery, the stability and range of motion of the prosthetic tends to be greater.
This method benefits patients with poor bone quality or bone health, notably older adults, because the patients have a lower capacity for generating new bone tissue at the interface of the implant for the other procedure, seen mostly in more senior patients.
</li>
            <li><b>Disadvantages:</b> The frequent problem that arises comes from the bone cement breaking and flaking causing inflammation, which in turn, can often lead to osteolysis and premature loosening of the prosthetic. 
                This is one of the reasons why the procedure is not recommended for younger and more active patients, because with greater physical activity there is a tendency for the cement to deteriorate more rapidly.
The cement during its hardening phase releases heat, which has the potential to damage the surrounding bone tissue.
The cement durability depends on the surgeon as there is not a standard procedure for the mixing, the cement also must be applied evenly and securely.
The implantâ€™s longevity only applies to older and less active patients, as a more active lifestyle would be detrimental.
The revision surgery is a complicated one as it involves removing the earlier cement used. Another problem seen is the weakening of the bone stock around the implant often needing a bone graft.

        </ul>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            The main driver for selecting cement or cementless TKA procedure main differences is the age of the patient, which in turn is related to the patientâ€™s overall health and bone quality. The skill and familiarity of the surgeon with the procedure is also a factor.
Cementless TKA: Best suited for younger, active patients with excellent bone quality. It relies on biological fixation, offering potential for greater longevity and more straight forward revision surgery. The procedure requires shorter surgical time but demands high surgical precision and may result in first instability. It is costly, and long-term data on outcomes is still limited.
Cemented TKA: Ideal for older patients or those with poor bone quality, as it provides immediate stability through bone cement. Recovery is quicker, and infection risk is reduced due to antibiotic-laden cement. However, the cement can wear or fracture over time, leading to loosening and potential need for complex revision surgeries.
