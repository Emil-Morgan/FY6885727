        <h1>Total Knee Arthroplasty</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Total knee arthroplasty (TKA), also known as total knee replacement surgery (TKR), is a surgical procedure performed to alleviate chronic knee pain and restore joint mobility in patients with severe arthritis, osteonecrosis, or other degenerative joint diseases. 
            This surgery provides significant relief, enabling patients to regain mobility while preventing further damage to adjacent joints, such as the hips.
        </p>
        <p>
            The procedure involves removing damaged cartilage and bone in the knee joint and replacing them with artificial components made from metal alloys and durable plastics, designed to mimic the function of a healthy knee. 
            While TKA delivers long-term benefits, artificial implants wear over time, necessitating revision surgeries, especially in younger and more active individuals. Nevertheless, TKA remains one of the most effective treatments for advanced knee degeneration, providing symptom relief and functional restoration when other treatments fail.
        </p>
        <p>
            Globally, TKA is among the most frequently performed orthopedic procedures, with over 100,000 annual operations in the UK alone. Cemented fixation is the dominant approach, utilized in approximately 95% of UK cases and 68.1% in Australia. 
            However, advancements in implant design and manufacturing have reinvigorated interest in cementless fixation, offering potential advantages, including shorter surgical times and longer-lasting biological fixation.
        </p>

        <h2>Main Body</h2>

        <h3>Cementless Fixation</h3>
        <p>
            This technique involves press-fitting metal prosthetic components onto the femur and tibia, with porous surfaces promoting bone ingrowth for stability. However, the patella is fixed with cement due to proven inefficacy of cementless fixation in this area.
        </p>

        <h4>Advantages</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Eliminates risks associated with bone cement, such as cracking, loosening, or osteolysis.</li>
            <li>Better suited for younger, active patients with strong bone stock, ensuring robust integration and durability.</li>
            <li>Shorter surgical times and simpler revision surgeries, as no cement removal is required.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Stability relies on bone growth, leading to initial discomfort and instability.</li>
            <li>Requires high bone quality, limiting its use to younger patients with good bone density.</li>
            <li>Demands precise surgical technique to ensure proper implant fixation and avoid gaps that may cause failure.</li>
            <li>Limited long-term data, as this approach is relatively new.</li>
            <li>High cost due to specialized materials and designs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cemented Fixation</h3>
        <p>
            In this method, the prosthetic components are secured using a fast-hardening bone cement. Unlike the cementless approach, the implants do not require a porous surface.
        </p>

        <h4>Advantages</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Established technique with extensive research showing durability of 10â€“20 years.</li>
            <li>Provides immediate implant stability, reducing recovery time.</li>
            <li>Bone cement includes antibiotics, lowering infection risks.</li>
            <li>Suitable for older patients or those with low bone quality, as it does not rely on bone growth.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Cement can crack and flake, leading to osteolysis and premature loosening.</li>
            <li>The hardening process generates high thermal energy, potentially damaging surrounding tissues.</li>
            <li>Implant durability depends on surgeon expertise and proper cement application.</li>
            <li>Revision surgeries are complex due to cement removal and weakened bone stock around the implant.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Comparison</h2>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Cementless TKR</th>
                <th>Cemented TKR</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Best for younger, active patients with excellent bone quality.</td>
                <td>Ideal for older patients or those with poor bone quality.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Relies on biological fixation, offering potential for greater longevity and easier revisions.</td>
                <td>Provides immediate stability through bone cement.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Demands high surgical precision; may result in initial instability.</td>
                <td>Recovery is quicker; infection risk is reduced due to antibiotic-laden cement.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The choice between cemented and cementless fixation for TKA depends on patient factors such as age, bone quality, activity level, and overall health, as well as the surgeon's skill. By tailoring the procedure to these factors, optimal long-term outcomes for mobility and joint health can be achieved.
