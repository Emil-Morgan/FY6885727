        <h1>A Scientific Comparison of Cemented and Cementless TKR</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Total knee arthroplasty (TKA), also known as total knee replacement surgery (TKR), is a surgical procedure performed to alleviate chronic knee pain and restore joint mobility in patients with severe arthritis, osteonecrosis,
            or other degenerative joint diseases. Surgery replacement will provide significant pain relief as well as return of mobility to the joint and prevent further damage and strain to spread to other joints such as the hips.
        </p>
        <p>
            The TKA procedure consists of removing damaged cartilage and bone from the knee joint and replacing them with artificial components, usually made from metal alloys and durable plastics to simulate the functions of a healthy knee.
            Although TKA can provide long-term relief, the artificial implants wear over time and need revision, especially in younger and more active patients, who may need revision surgery in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            TKA is still one of the most effective treatments for severe knee degeneration, by relieving symptoms and restoring function when conservative treatments have failed. Globally, TKA has become one of the most common orthopaedic procedures, with over 100,000 operations performed annually in the UK alone.
            Cemented fixation is the predominant method, used in approximately 95% of primary TKR in the UK and 68% in Australia, where cementless fixation accounts for only 11% of cases. However, advances in implant design and manufacturing technology have renewed interest in cementless fixation. This method offers potential advantages,
            such as shorter surgical times and the possibility of long-lasting biological fixation, making it a promising possibility for certain patient populations.
        </p>

        <h2>Main Body</h2>
        <p>
            During TKA, the metal parts of the prosthesis are fixed with two different methods:
        </p>

        <h3>Cementless Fixation</h3>
        <p>
            Cementless fixation is done by press fitting the metal parts that attach to the femur and tibia. The components are made specifically with a porous surface to allow the bone to grow and attach itself to the components, and the bones are shaped in a way to ensure a tight fit around the implants.
            However, bone cement is used to fix the patella in place because the cementless method has been shown to be ineffective for this purpose.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Advantages:</b> This method does not have drawbacks associated with bone cement, such as cracking and loosening. It is more suitable for younger patients with good bone health. The surgery is shorter, and revision is simpler.</li>
            <li><b>Disadvantages:</b> Longer time for implant fixation, potential instability during recovery, requires surgical precision, and is more expensive.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cemented Fixation</h3>
        <p>
            The surgeon drills a hole in the tibia slightly larger than the implant to leave space for bone cement, a mixture that is long-lasting and fast-hardening. The implants differ as they do not require a porous surface. The patella is fixed with bone cement in both cases.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Advantages:</b> Immediate stability, shorter recovery time, reduced infection risk due to antibiotics in cement, suitable for older patients.</li>
            <li><b>Disadvantages:</b> Cement can crack or flake, leading to loosening and revision complexity. Heat during cement hardening can damage bone tissue.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            The choice between cemented and cementless TKA depends on patient age, bone health, and activity level. Cemented fixation is better suited for older, less active patients, while cementless fixation is ideal for younger, more active individuals.
        </p>
